All portions of part 1 are finished. All http tests were performed on chrome.
All https tests were performed using Microsoft Edge. For part 2, everything
except part 2.5 (the directory browsing) has been completed. For part 2.4, as
extra credit, the stats and logs responses work for the linear, thread and pool
of threads options. The stats and logs pages, however, do not work for the fork
option. All valid user name and password combninations are stored in
"authorized_users_in_text.txt" No known memory leak or file descriptor leaks
occur.

**Important Note: I do not have firefox on my computer, and have therefore
  not done any tests with it. Google Chrome is known to work with everything
  except https, which instead uses Microsoft Edge. Please use either of
  these browsers for the purpose of testing**
